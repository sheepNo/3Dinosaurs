# 3Dinosaurs

This is the M1 Mosig 3D project of the group composed of Ning Tang, Etienne Bontemps and Th√©o Barollet

## Use

The entrypoint of the application is
```
./dinosaurs.py
```

# Files

For now there are three files in the application:
- dinosaurs.py that creates the OpenGL context, loads the models and the shaders and starts rendering
- model_loading.py that loads model files into renderable objects
- shaders.py that loads all the shaders used in the program
